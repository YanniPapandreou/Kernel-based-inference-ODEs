# Kernel-Based Inference Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations

During my MSc in Statistics at Imperial I undertook a summer research project under the supervision of [Dr Andrew Duncan](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/). This project involved inference in generative models based on ODEs. In particular, an adjoint method for gradient descent in high-dimensional parameter spaces was studied.

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks associated with this project, as well as a copy of the thesis I wrote for this project (the file named `msc_thesis_yanni_papandreou.pdf`).
